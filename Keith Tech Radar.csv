Isto,Trial,Platform,TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://istio.io/"">Istio</a></strong> is becoming the de facto infrastructure to operationalize a <a href=""https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"">microservices</a> ecosystem. Its out-of-the-box implementation of cross-cutting concerns — such as service discovery, service-to-service and origin-to-service security, observability (including telemetry and distributed tracing), rolling releases and resiliency — has been bootstrapping our microservices implementations very quickly. It's the main implementation of the <a href=""/radar/techniques/service-mesh"">service mesh</a> technique we've been using. We've been enjoying its monthly releases and its continuous improvements with seamless upgrades. We use Istio to bootstrap our projects, starting with observability (tracing and telemetry) and service-to-service security. We're closely watching its improvements to service-to-service authentication everywhere in and outside of the mesh. We'd also like to see Istio establish best practices for configuration files to strike a balance between giving autonomy to service developers and control to the service mesh operators.</p>"
Openshift / Kubernetes,Adopt,Platform,FALSE,"Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience that Google has with running production workloads at scale, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

Aurora Mysql,Assess,Database,TRUE,"<p>Amazon Aurora is up to five times faster than standard <a></a><a href=""/rds/mysql/what-is-mysql/"">MySQL</a> databases and three times faster than standard PostgreSQL databases. It provides the security, availability, and reliability of commercial databases at 1/10th the cost. Amazon Aurora is fully managed by <a></a><a href=""/rds/"">Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)</a>, which automates time-consuming administration tasks like hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups.</p>"
The Four Key Metrics,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>The thorough <a href=""https://devops-research.com/research.html"">State of DevOps</a> reports have focused on data-driven and statistical analysis of high-performing organizations. The result of this multiyear research, published in <a href=""https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/"">Accelerate</a>, demonstrates a direct link between organizational performance and software delivery performance. The researchers have determined that only <strong>four key metrics</strong> differentiate between low, medium and high performers: lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore (MTTR) and change fail percentage. Indeed, we've found that these four key metrics are a simple and yet powerful tool to help leaders and teams focus on measuring and improving what matters. A good place to start is to instrument the build pipelines so you can capture the four key metrics and make the software delivery value stream visible. <a href=""https://www.gocd.org/"">GoCD pipelines,</a> for example, provide the ability to measure these four key metrics as a first-class citizen of the <a href=""https://www.gocd.org/analytics.html"">GoCD analytics</a>.</p>"
Kubernetes Operators,Assess,Tools,TRUE,"<p>We're excited about the impact <a href=""/radar/platforms/kubernetes"">Kubernetes</a> has had on our industry but also concerned about the operational complexity that comes with it. Keeping a Kubernetes cluster up and running and then managing packages deployed on it requires special skills and time. Operational processes such as upgrades, migrations, backups, among others, can be a full-time job. We think that <strong><a href=""https://coreos.com/operators/"">Kubernetes Operators</a></strong> will play a key role in reducing this complexity. The framework provides a standard mechanism to describe automated operational processes for packages running in a Kubernetes cluster. Although Operators were spearheaded and promoted by RedHat, several community-developed Operators for common open-source packages such as <a href=""/radar/tools/jaeger"">Jaeger</a>, <a href=""/radar/platforms/mongodb"">MongoDB</a> and <a href=""/radar/platforms/redis"">Redis</a> have begun to emerge.</p>"
